# Commit Skill

## When to Use
- User asks to commit changes
- After completing a task that modified files
- When user says "commit this" or similar

## Workflow

1. **Check status**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --staged
   ```

2. **Review changes**
   - Understand what was modified
   - Group related changes logically
   - Identify if multiple commits are needed

3. **Stage files**
   - Stage only related changes together
   - Never stage secrets or credentials
   - Skip generated files unless intentional

4. **Write commit message**
   Format: `type(scope): description`

   Types:
   - `feat` - New feature
   - `fix` - Bug fix
   - `refactor` - Code restructuring
   - `docs` - Documentation only
   - `test` - Adding/fixing tests
   - `chore` - Maintenance tasks

5. **Commit**
   - Use descriptive message focusing on "why" not "what"
   - Keep first line under 72 characters
   - Add body for complex changes

## Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(auth): add password reset flow"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null response from external service"

# Refactor
git commit -m "refactor(utils): extract date formatting to shared helper"
```

## Do NOT
- Commit without user confirmation
- Include "Generated by Claude" attribution (unless requested)
- Force push or amend without asking
- Commit .env files or secrets
